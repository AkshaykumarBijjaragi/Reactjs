## Approach for Creating Star Ratings Component

### 1. Basic Layout of Star Ratings Structure:

- Create a simple layout for the star ratings component.
- Each star is represented by a Unicode character, and the stars are displayed in a horizontal row.
- The layout includes a container to hold the stars and a paragraph to display the selected rating.

### 2. Logic for Star Rating:

- Initialize a state variable (`rating`) using the `useState` hook to manage the selected rating.
- Create a function (`handleStarClick`) to update the rating when a star is clicked.
- Map through an array of star values and render each star with an `onClick` event to call the `handleStarClick` function.
- Style the stars to change color based on whether they are selected or not.
